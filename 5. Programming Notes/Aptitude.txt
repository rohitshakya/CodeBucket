A reduction in the price of mangoes by 20% enables a farmer to purchase 12 more mangoes for Rs. 15. So what could be the price of 16 mangoes before the reduction of the price?
a) Rs. 9
b) Rs. 7
c) Rs. 5
d) Rs. 6


Answer: c) Rs. 5
Solution:
We know that
Price * Consumption = Expenditure
and, Consumption = Expenditure Price
So,
(15 / 8x) – (15 / x) = 12
x = (15 * 2) / (12 * 8)
For 16 Mangoes = [(15 * 2) / (12 * 8)] * 16 = 5 (answer)

So, LCM = 2*2*2*2*3*5*5 = 1200 secs = 20 min.
Therefore, they will beep together at 12:20 PM next.

Ram purchased 20 dozens of toys at the rate of Rs. 375 per dozen. He sold each one of them at the rate of Rs. 33. What was his percentage profit?
a) 5.6 %
b) 4.5 %
c) 3.5 %
d) 6.5 %
Answer: a) 5.6 %
Solution:
Let’s find the cost price of 1 toy = 375 / 12 = 31.25 rupees.
Now, SP of 1 toy = 33 rupees.
So, Gain = SP – CP = (33 – 31.25) = Rs. 1.75
and Profit % = 1.75 / 31.25 * 100 = 5.6 %

a) 300
b) 330
c) 333
d) None of these
Answer: b) 330
Solution:
For the 6 at the unit place:
When the digits are changed to 9, each value will increase by 3. Since there are 10 such numbers, so total increase = 10 * 3 = 30
For the 6 at 10’s place:
When the digits are changed to 9, each value will increase by 30. Since there are 10 such numbers, so total increase = 10 * 30 = 300
So the total increase will be 30 + 300 = 330

In a group of persons travelling in a bus, 6 persons can speak Tamil, 15 can speak Hindi and 6 can speak Gujarati. In that group, none can speak any other language. If 2 persons in the group can speak two languages and one person can speak all the three languages, then how many persons are there in the group?
a) 21
b) 22
c) 24
d) 23


Answer: d) 23
Solution:
Assuming the two persons who can speak two languages be Hindi and Tamil and the third person speaks all the three languages.
Therefore, the number of people who can speak Tamil is 6. Only Tamil = 6 – 2 – 1 = 3
Therefore, the number of people who can speak Hindi is 15. Only Hindi = 15 – 2 – 1 = 12
Therefore, the number of people who can speak Gujarati is 6. Only Gujarati = 6 – 1 = 5
Thus the number of persons who can speak only one language is 3 + 12 + 5 = 20
Given,
The number of persons who can speak two languages is 2
The number of people who speak all three languages is 1
Therefore the answer is 23.

A secret can be said by only 2 persons in 5 minutes. The same person tells the secret to 2 more persons and so on. How long will take to tell it to tell 768 persons?
a) 500 min
b) 50 min
c) 47.5 min
d) 49 min
Answer: c) 47.5 min 
Solution:
One person telling to 2 means he takes 2.5 min to tell the secret to 1 person,
So 1 person telling the truth to another 2 people and the next two telling the truth to the next two who in turn are telling another 2 people and so on…
Therefore a series is formed of 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16 and so on…
Therefore a series of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,…, 512
Till 512 it would take
Till this will take 45 minutes and now these people i.e., 256 will be telling the truth to only 1 of the total person will be 768,
Therefore, 45 + 2.5 = 47.5 min

So, this is the required ratio.
= 14x : 21x: 28x
= 2 : 3 : 4

A hollow iron pipe is 21 cm long and its external diameter is 8 cm. If the thickness of the pipe is 1 cm and iron weighs 8 g/cm3, then the weight of the pipe is:
a) 3.6 kg
b) 3.696 kg
c) 36 kg
d) 36.9 kg
Answer: b) 3.696 kg
Solution:
Given the external diameter = 8 cm. Therefore, the radius = 4 cm.
The thickness = 1 cm. Therefore the internal radius = 4 – 1 = 3 cm
The volume of the iron = pi * (R^2 – r^2) * length
= 22/7 * [(4^2) – (3^2)] * 21 cubic-cm
= 462 cubic-cm
Therefore, the weight of iron = 462 * 8 gm = 3.696 kg

Rohit’s father is three times elder than Rohit. After 8 years, he would be two and a half times of Rohit’s age. After a further 8 years, how many times would he be of Rohit’s age?
a) 2 times
b) 2.5 times
c) 2.75 times
d) 3 times.


Answer: a) 2 times
Solution:
Let Rohit present age be x years
Therefore father’s age is x + 3x = 4x years
According to the question,
4x + 8 = 5/2(x + 8)
=> 3x = 24
=> x = 8
So the answer is: (4x + 16) / (x + 16) = 48/24 = 2

A tap can fill a bucket in 6 hours. After half the bucket is filled, three more similar taps are opened. What is the total time taken to fill the bucket completely?
a) 3 hrs 45 min
b) 3 hrs 15 min
c) 4 hrs 15 min
d) 4 hrs 45 min
Answer: a) 3 hrs 45 min
Solution:
Time is taken by one tap to fill half the bucket = 3 hours
So the part filled 4 taps in one hour = 4 * (1/6) = 2/3 of the bucket.
Therefore, the remaining part is = (1 – 1/2) = 1/2
Proportinally = 2/3 : 1/2 :: 1 : x
=> x = 3/4 hours = 45 minutes. So the total time = 3 hrs 45 minutes.

A ship, whose speed in 15 km/hr in still water goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. What is the speed of the stream in km/hr?
a) 4
b) 6
c) 5
d) 10
Answer: c) 5
Solution:
Let the speed of the stream be x km/hr.
Therfore the, speed of downstream = (15 + x) km/hr,
and speed of upstream = (15 – x) km/hr.
According to the question,
30/(15 + x) + 30/(15 – x) = 9/2
or, 900/(225 – x^2) = 9/2
or, 9x^2 = 225
or, x^2 = 25
or, x = 5 km/hr.

In a mixture 60 litres, the ratio of milk to water is 2:1. If this ratio is to be 1:2, then what is the quantity of water needed to be further?
a) 60 litres
b) 50 litres
c) 40 litres
d) 30 litres
Answer: a) 60 litres
Solution:
From the given ratio we can deduce the quantity of milk as = 60 * (2/3) = 40 lit
and the quantity of water = 60 – 40 = 20 lit
The new ratio must be 1:2
Let the quantity of water to be added be x lit.
Then milk:water = 40 / (20 + x)
This should be equal to = 1/2
=> 20 + x = 80
or, x = 60
