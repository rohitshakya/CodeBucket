Given an integer k and a queue of integers, how do you reverse the order of the
first k elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order? For
example, if k=4 and queue has the elements [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]; the output
should be [40, 30, 20, 10, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90].
